Welcome to the OCCS Unix Scavenger Hunt!

This is a challenge designed to get you acquainted with the powerful tools Unix offers.

First and most useful feature on your terminal: tab autocomplete:
If you type part of any file or program in your directory, it will autocomplete
as much as it can.

To find information on any Unix command, type

man <command>

So if I wanted information on the unix command "ls", I would type

man ls

Useful commands for this scavenger hunt:
ls - list the contents of a directory
echo - print a string
cd - change the current working directory
cat - print the contents of a file
less - view the contents of a file
text editors nano, vim, and emacs - editors designed specifically for efficiently writing code
find - find a file in the directory structure
grep - a tool for searching for text and patterns in files, directories, and input
sed - a tool for searching and replacing patterns in files and input
chmod - change permissions on a file
sort - a tool for sorting text
wc - count the words/lines in a file or input
du - get the size of a file
head - get first n lines of a file or input
tail - get last n lines of a file or input
for loops - iterate over lists or lines of text
pipe | - redirect the output of one program to the input of the next program
backticks ``: when you want the result of running a program to be entered as an argument:
example of backticks: less `which cookie` captures the output of "which cookie" and uses "less" to view it
redirect > < >> << - redirect the standard input or output of a program to or from a file




To get started with the challenge, you should use the command
ls -a
to show hidden files and directories

Good Luck!
